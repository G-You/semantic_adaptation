## For quick replication of figures and tables

Please check out the R scripts main_analyses.R and the markdown of supplementary materials.

## Full replication

For fetching data and building models, run the bash script:

```bash
chmod +x full.sh
./full.sh
```

Some empty folders might need to be first created to proceed.

For the break-point analyses, run:

```bash
chmod +x bp_analyses.sh
./bp_analyses.sh
```

This might take days to finish.
